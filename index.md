## Welcome

Biodiversity is caracterised by a network of entities with specific properties, interacting or not together and with their environment according to this properties. These entities are constantly evolving thanks to different evolutionary forces. In my research, I am broadly interested in the evolution of those entities especially those defining the microorganisms' diversity over geological times and in terms of species richness, ecological and metabolical strategies, promoting or preventing their interactions. Learn more about my specific projects in the [research](research.md) section.
